<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª A bit about me</h2>
<p>
  Hailing from Detroit, my journey through the tech landscape has been rich and varied, spanning roles from Senior to Lead Software Engineer. Over a 12-year span, I've honed a particular expertise in software architecture and web development, grounded in a robust background in IT and networking. Beyond the binaries and algorithms, I find my creative outlet in making music, a harmony of notes that complements my code.
